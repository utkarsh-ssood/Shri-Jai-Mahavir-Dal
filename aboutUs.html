                        <p>Welcome to <b>Shri Jai Mahavir Sewa Samiti Dal</b>, a sacred heaven of
                            devotion, community, and spirituality. For a quarter
                            of a century, our organization has been a steadfast
                            symbol of unwavering faith and dedication to the
                            teachings of Lord Hanuman.
</p>
                            <h2 class="c1" style="font-size:20px ;color:white;">Our Mission</h2>
<p>
                            At Shri Jai Mahavir Sewa Samiti Dal, our mission is simple yet
                            profound - to inspire and unite people through the
                            spiritual essence of Lord Hanuman's teachings. We
                            are committed to fostering a sense of belonging,
                            love, and strength within our community, promoting
                            the values of courage, devotion, and selflessness
                            that Lord Hanuman represents.
                        </p>
                            <h2 class="c1" style="font-size:20px ;color:white;">A Legacy of Devotion</h2>
<p>
                            Founded 25 years ago, our journey began with a
                            vision to create a platform for people to come
                            together in devotion and celebration. Over the
                            years, we have grown into a vibrant community of
                            individuals who share a common bond of reverence for
                            Lord Hanuman. Our annual 3-day event, celebrated
                            with great pomp and devotion, stands as a testament
                            to our enduring commitment to this vision.
</p>
<h2 class="c1" style="font-size:20px ;color:white;">History of Panj Pipli Mandir</h2>

<p>Panj Pipli Mandir, our sacred temple, is steeped in history and spirituality. This ancient temple, with around 300 years of existence, stands as a testament to the rich heritage of devotion in our region. Originally dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple has been a place of worship and solace for countless generations. Its enduring presence serves as a reminder of the deep-rooted spiritual traditions that have been passed down through the ages. Today, within the tranquil walls of Panj Pipli Mandir, devotees not only seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman but also connect with the timeless spirituality that flows through this historic shrine.
